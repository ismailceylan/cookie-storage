This library provides a simple interface that allows you to work with cookie structures in a similar way to storage interfaces such as localStorage and sessionStorage that come with html5.

**Note: If you edit cookies through the Developer Console, the changes you make will not be reflected in the caching on the library and will cause unstable operation. If you are using this library, make the changes directly with the library methods instead of making changes through the developer console.**
